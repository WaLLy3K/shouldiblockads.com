</header>
<p><i>Ad blockers</i>, or you'll sometimes hear them called <i>content blockers</i> <sup id=boot-1><a href=#foot-1>1</a></sup>, are programs that prevent your computer from downloading ads. They're kind of like parental controls, anti-virus software, and email spam filters.
<p>Once you've started using an ad blocker, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Blocking ads will reduce your risk of being defrauded or getting a computer virus, and make your computer run faster than when it was new.
<h2>What's wrong with ads?</h2>
<section>
  <h3>Ads lie about who they're from</h3>
  <p>Google has run ads, for months at a time, pretending to be from the government. And even when they receive complaints, it's hard to get them to act.</p>
  <footer><a href=https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/03/tech/google-fishing-licenses-scam-ads/index.html>Read about it on CNN</a></footer>
</section>
<section>
  <h3>Ads include harmful scripts</h3>
  <p>YouTube has run ads that included scripts<sup id=boot-2><a href=#foot-2>2</a></sup> that earn the advertisers cryptocurrency by burning visitors' battery power on "mining" algorithms. You don't even have to click the ad for it to run.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <h3>Ad network algorithms are easily cheated</h3>
  <p>Researchers have proven that Facebook's checks for whether a company is a good target are not very good. They can make a company look like it has an established, expensive-to-burn identity without actually spending that much money or doing that much work.</p>

  <h3>Ads link to malicious software</h3>
  <p>In one incident, many major news websites hosted ads that linked to ransomeware, programs that, if you followed the ad and installed it, would encrypt everything on your computer and demand money to restore it.

</section>
<p>And these aren't isolated incidents either. While one advertiser pretends to be the government, <a href=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/beware-of-amazon-prime-support-scams-in-google-search-ads/>another one claims to be Amazon</a>, <a href=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ads-in-google-search-results-redirect-users-to-tech-support-scam/>another claims to be from Microsoft</a>, and anoter one claims to be <a href=https://www.luno.com/blog/en/post/google-ads-phishing-scams-identify-avoid>a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.
<p>Wired.com was hit with <a href=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/04/rogue-ad-wired/>an ad that took over the entire page</a>, TV Tropes has a <a href=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=13223684920A10189100>public record of hundreds of ads that have broken their website</a>, and <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20530056>BidFilter</a> (an ad tech company) has a report on how one worked.
<h2>Do ad blockers make it impossible to monetize web pages using ads?</h2>
<p>That's impossible. Advertisements are really just content that's written with a particular goal, and ad blockers can't know what the intent behind a web page is. Most ad block lists are designed to only block things that the user didn't deliberately want to open, even if the thing that the user is opening is technically a sales pitch anyway.
<p>Mostly, ad blockers will block something if it is sent through an ad network.
<p>An <i>ad network</i> is a company that matches up ads with websites. It's kind of like online dating: the web sites and advertisers use keywords to identify the interests that they cater to, and the ad network is the matchmaker that puts them together <sup id=boot-3><a href=#foot-3>3</a></sup>.
<section class=center><img src=cheesy-diagram.svg></section>
<p>And all of the downsides of online dating apply to ad networking. The author of the content might be perfectly trustworthy, but if their website is matched with a bad advertiser, the result is a really bad date. And because ad networks are so permissive, nobody knows if it's going to turn out well until it's already too late.
<p>Ad blockers will definitely not block advertisements <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Manufacturing-Consent-audiobook/dp/B06Y2LSTZZ>that are completely integrated with the content that you wanted to open</a>, but when that sort of thing happens, it means that the author of the content knew about what they were advertising. Figuring out if you can trust the author of the web page that you opened is something you had to do anyway.
<h2>So, how do I block ads?</h2>
<section id=ub>
  <img src=ublockorigin.png class=pull-right>
  <h3 id=ub-h>uBlock Origin for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge</h3>
  <p>This is the one we recommend, because it's very powerful, and it includes tools for dealing with web sites that try to prevent ad blockers from working. It's also easy to install, since it's just a browser add-on.

  <h3>1Blocker for Apple Safari</h3>
  <p>Since uBlock Origin doesn't work in the current version of Safari, I recommend this one instead. You can install it on a Mac, iPhone, or iPad.
  <footer>Download for <a id=ob-mac href=https://apps.apple.com/app/id1107421413>Apple macOS</a> &bull; <a id=ob-ios href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1365531024>Apple iOS</a>

  <img src=pihole.svg class=pull-right>
  <h3>Pi-Hole for embedded computers</h3>
  <p>This one is the best option if you have lots of computers. You install pi-hole on your network, reconfigure your modem or router, and every computer in your home or small office will have its ads blocked.
  <footer>Installation instructions are <a href=https://pi-hole.net/>on their website</a>
</section>
<p>And, as always, browse responsibly!
<footer id=foot-1><sup><a href=#boot-1>1</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;the programs that we recommend support custom block lists, and there's no rule saying that the block list that you program has to be a list of <em>advertisements</em>, so calling them ad blockers is kind of underselling the power of software like this. But this essay is about how blocking ads is a good thing, so let's stick with that for now.</footer>
<footer id=foot-2><sup><a href=#boot-2>2</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;A web script is a set of instructions, attached to a web page, telling your computer to do things after the web page has loaded. The kinds of instructions that a script can include are intentionally limited &mdash; for example, a web script can't run your printer without asking you first &mdash; but one thing they can do is have your computer perform some math and then send the results back to the website that it got the script from. Cryptocurrency mining is designed under the assumption that performing math costs lots of money for whoever intends to earn it that way, but doing it by attaching a web script to an ad and having the math performed on random web visitors' computer instead might be cheaper.</footer>
<footer id=foot-3><sup><a href=#boot-3>3</a></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ad networks also collect lists of interests of individual readers, so they're actually matching up trios, not couples. But the analogy would still be useful either way.</footer>
